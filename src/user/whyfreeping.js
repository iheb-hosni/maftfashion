                <p  className="eckki-text">
                Last month, we have announced our Freep Project on our platform which is an art project where we will be sharing Maft’s vision with a focus on stylish Tunisian freepers (as we call them) who find their happiness in these places for so many interesting reasons.
Some people prefer buying from brands stores for sure because they enjoy the whole shopping experience.  It is true that the research is simpler and that all the items are perfectly placed on the hangers and no one has to dig in a big pile of used clothes like in thrift store. Other people, meanwhile, appreciate the charm of the souks and often go there to find some items and come back smiling with the feeling of an accomplished mission. In this short article, we are trying to highligh the advantages of thrifting based on our personal experiences:

                <p className="eckki-text">1.	Realize considerable savings, given the prices of imported ready-to-wear  goods. You can thrift with a very low budget. We can confirm that  while working on this project we proudly bought so many clothes worth 1 dinar per piece and sometimes less than that.<br/>
2.	You may find  designer products or inaccessible international brands ( Gucci , Louis V ..). If you dig through the piles, you might be surprised by the choices.<br/>
3.	You’ll develop a unique wardrobe.  In freeps, you will have the chance to buy a variety of clothing without finding yourself wearing the same top or dress as your friends or any other people. The opportunity to stand out with a singular style and have the chance to wear unique pieces. You will be Unique because you will rarely bump into someone wearing the exact same thing.
